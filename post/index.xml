      <description>I have been recently working on a project where I got an issue with the anchor &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tag. The issue was with the hover effect on the anchor tag. There was no hover effect over the link. Plus, the link was not working either. However, the hover effect was seen below the link for small space. The anchor element had a &amp;lt;object&amp;gt; element inside it and that was the reason of the issue.</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried running filter with multiple senders or recipients in GMail? I was working on filtering a list of emails coming from GitHub and forward it to another email address.
However, there was always an option to create individual filter. But, it felt hard or boring or lazy to do the same for 8 filters. So, I went for a search and found a solution after some time and would like to share it with you all.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I have been using Arch Linux and loving it since because of its flexibility. In the mean time, I have installed the same OS for many times because I tried new things and crashed a lot of installed things. Literally, thinking about the time to repair, I just re-installed the OS. It just feels quick and easy to clear out all your garbage. However, it&amp;rsquo;s a pain to setup all those applications and configuration.</description>
