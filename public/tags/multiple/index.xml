      <description>Have you ever tried running filter with multiple senders or recipients in GMail? I was working on filtering a list of emails coming from GitHub and forward it to another email address.
However, there was always an option to create individual filter. But, it felt hard or boring or lazy to do the same for 8 filters. So, I went for a search and found a solution after some time and would like to share it with you all.</description>
